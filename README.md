Three observable trends based on the data for the Heros of Pymoli are as follows:
1.	GENDER
•	There are 576 total players, of which, 81 are female, and 484 are male. 11 have not disclosed their genders. The average purchase price is the highest in the undisclosed group, and the female group follows. However, the highest total purchase value is from the male group due to simply the size of the group. 

2.	AGE
•	The age demographics is parabolic (negative in nature), with the most popular age range from 20-24 (vertex). As such, this age group is also the group that spends the most. However, it is interesting to note that this group is not the highest when it comes to per person spending. The age group that has the highest average purchase price is form 35-39, followed by the under 10 group. 

3.	POPULAR ITEMS
•	The most popular item, with a purchase count of 12 is Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm. This is also the most profitable item. However, it has the lowest price in the top 5, which suggests the players are price sensitive and other items in the top 5 may benefit by decreasing prices in order to raise sales.
